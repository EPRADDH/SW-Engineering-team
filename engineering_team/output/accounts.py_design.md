# accounts.py Module Design

The `accounts.py` module will contain the `Account` class that will handle all functionalities required for the trading simulation platform. Below is the detailed design of the module including the classes and methods.

```python
# accounts.py

class Account:
    def __init__(self, username: str, initial_deposit: float):
        """
        Initializes an account for a user with a specific username and initial deposit.

        Args:
        - username (str): The username of the account holder.
        - initial_deposit (float): The starting amount of money in the account.
        """
        pass

    def deposit(self, amount: float) -> None:
        """
        Deposits funds into the user's account.

        Args:
        - amount (float): The amount of money to deposit.
        """
        pass

    def withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        """
        Withdraws funds from the user's account if sufficient funds are available.

        Args:
        - amount (float): The amount of money to withdraw.

        Returns:
        - bool: True if the withdrawal was successful, False otherwise.
        """
        pass

    def buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:
        """
        Buys shares for a specific symbol if sufficient funds are available.

        Args:
        - symbol (str): The stock symbol to buy.
        - quantity (int): The number of shares to purchase.

        Returns:
        - bool: True if the purchase was successful, False otherwise.
        """
        pass

    def sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:
        """
        Sells shares for a specific symbol if the user holds enough shares.

        Args:
        - symbol (str): The stock symbol to sell.
        - quantity (int): The number of shares to sell.

        Returns:
        - bool: True if the sale was successful, False otherwise.
        """
        pass

    def get_portfolio_value(self) -> float:
        """
        Calculates the current total value of the user's portfolio including cash and assets.

        Returns:
        - float: The total value of the portfolio in dollars.
        """
        pass

    def get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float:
        """
        Calculates the profit or loss based on the initial deposit and the current portfolio value.

        Returns:
        - float: The profit or loss in dollars.
        """
        pass

    def list_transactions(self) -> list:
        """
        Lists all transactions made by the user over time.

        Returns:
        - list: A list of transaction details.
        """
        pass

    def get_holdings(self) -> dict:
        """
        Reports the current holdings of the user.

        Returns:
        - dict: A dictionary with stock symbols as keys and quantities as values.
        """
        pass

# External dependency function
def get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float:
    """
    Retrieves the current price of a share for a given symbol.

    For testing purposes, use fixed prices for certain test symbols.

    Args:
    - symbol (str): The stock symbol whose price is needed.

    Returns:
    - float: The current price of the stock.
    """
    test_prices = {'AAPL': 150.0, 'TSLA': 700.0, 'GOOGL': 2800.0}
    return test_prices.get(symbol, 0.0) 
```

### Functionality and Constraints

- **Account Initialization:** Each account is created with a username and an initial deposit to set the starting cash balance.
- **Deposit and Withdraw:** Users can deposit any amount but can only withdraw if they have enough funds.
- **Buy and Sell Shares:** Transactions are only allowed if the user has adequate funds for buying or sufficient shares for selling.
- **Portfolio and Profit Calculation:** The system can calculate the current portfolio value and profit/loss compared to the initial account balance.
- **Transaction and Holding Reports:** The system can generate reports of historical trades and current stock holdings for the user.

The above design encapsulates all necessary features and ensures a modular approach, providing clear entry points for future testing or UI integration.
